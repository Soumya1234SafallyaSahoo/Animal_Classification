🐾 Animal Image Classification

This project develops a deep learning model to classify images of animals into their correct categories. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract visual features from images and make accurate predictions.

🔎 Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications ranging from wildlife monitoring to automated tagging. This project applies deep learning to classify animal images into predefined categories.

📝 Problem Statement

Build a system to automatically classify animal images into their correct categories.

Handle variations in lighting, pose, and background to achieve robust classification.

Evaluate different architectures to find the best-performing model.

🎯 Objectives

Collect and preprocess a labeled dataset of animal images.

Implement image augmentation (resize, normalize, flip, rotate) for better generalization.

Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features and classify animals.

Evaluate model performance on test data.

📊 Data Description

Source: Custom dataset / Kaggle dataset (e.g., Animals-10, CIFAR-10 animals subset).

Classes: Multiple animal categories (e.g., dog, cat, lion, elephant, etc.).

Images: Thousands of labeled images per class.

Preprocessing: Images resized to uniform dimensions (e.g., 128×128 px) and normalized.

⚙️ Methodology
A. Data Preprocessing

Resize all images to the same shape.

Normalize pixel values to [0,1].

Augment data (random flips, rotations, zoom, brightness shift).

Split into train, validation, and test sets.

B. Model Development

Build a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Use ReLU activation and softmax for final classification.

Optimize with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

C. Evaluation

Track training and validation accuracy/loss.

Test on unseen data and compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize confusion matrix to identify misclassifications.

📈 Results & Analysis

Achieved high classification accuracy on test images.

Model successfully generalizes to new animal images with different poses/backgrounds.

Data augmentation improved robustness compared to non-augmented training.

💡 Insights

More training images per class improved model accuracy.

CNN outperformed traditional ML approaches (SVM, KNN) on raw pixels.

Misclassifications often occurred between visually similar species.

📝 Recommendations

Increase dataset size for underrepresented classes.

Use transfer learning (e.g., pre-trained ResNet, MobileNet) for higher accuracy.

Deploy as a web or mobile app for real-time animal recognition.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Version Control: GitHub

🚀 Future Scope

Expand to multi-label classification (detect multiple animals in one image).

Combine with object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN) for bounding boxes.

Integrate with IoT cameras for automated wildlife monitoring.
